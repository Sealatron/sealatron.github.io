My name's Adam Mackie, a software engineer based in Scotland. I studied Physics with Applied Computing at the University of Dundee and went on to complete a Masters in Physics at the University of Strathclyde, where I graduated in 2014. Since 2015 I've been working in Edinburgh as an Embedded Software Engineer, mostly in C/C++ programming.

This site is new but I aim to fill it with details about personal projects I'm working on in a few areas of interest, which includes (but may not be limited to): gamedev experiments, computational physics stuff, and maybe even some (analogue!) art stuff which I'm just getting back into. It's a space where I might share my work and (terrible) thoughts on various topics that interest me.

You can reach me at any of my socials listed on this site - but I don't post much!
