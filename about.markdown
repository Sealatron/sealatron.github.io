Alright! I am Adam Mackie, a software engineer with a background in physics, based out of Scotland. Since 2015 I've been working as an embedded software engineer, almost exclusively in C/C++ programming.

This site is new but I aim to fill with details about personal projects I'm working on in a few areas of interest, including some gamedev experiments, computational physics stuff, and maybe even some (analogue!) art stuff which I'm just getting back into. It's a space where I might share my work and (terrible) thoughts on various topics that interest me.

You can reach me at any of my socials listed on this site - I don't post much!
